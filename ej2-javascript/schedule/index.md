The **Scheduler** component is an event calendar which facilitates user with the common Outlook and Google calendar features,
thus allowing the users to plan and manage their events or appointments and its time in an efficient way.

## Key Features

* **Views** - Scheduler is now available with 10 different view modes – day, week, work week, month, timeline day, timeline week, timeline work week, timeline month, agenda and month agenda.
It is possible to configure view-based settings on each view mode. The `Week` view is set as active view by default.
* **Data binding** - Seamless data binding with various client-
side and remote data sources thus allowing the data to load on demand by default to reduce the data transfer and loading time.
* **Recurrence options** - Allows the user to repeat a set of events on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.
* **Drag and Drop** - Events can be easily rescheduled by simply dragging and dropping them onto a new desired location.
* **Resizing** - Allows to change the event timing by resizing them to the desired time interval using its handlers.
* **Custom editor template** - Template option is available for event editor,
thus allowing the users to add their own custom modal design and also provides option to add additional fields onto the default event editor.
* **Adaptive rendering** - Adapts with optimal user interface on mobile and desktop,
thus helping the user's application to scale elegantly across all the form-factors without any additional effort.

vertical hierarchy one after the other (Calendar views).
* **Virtual scrolling** - Allows to load a large set of resources and events on Scheduler instantly as you scroll, to experience better performance.

Scheduler supports setting your own required time zone value to it as well as to each event –
thus allowing the events to display on its exact local time.
* **Block time intervals** - The specific range of date and time on Scheduler can be blocked, thus preventing it from user interactions.

work cells and event tooltip comes with the default template support which allows the flexible end-user customization to embed any kind of text,
images, or styles to it.

Also, the working days collection can be customized with specific days, so that the remaining days will be considered as weekend. There is also an option to set different working hours for each resource.
* **Export/Import** - Supports exporting and importing of appointment(s) to and from an ICS file and also appointment(s) data can be exported as excel file format.
* **Localization** - All the static text and date content on Scheduler can be localized to any desired language.
